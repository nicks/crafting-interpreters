Homework for Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom

## Copyright

Copyright Unknown! Best guess is Robert Nystrom!

Robert's book contains code snippets in Java.

I transcribed the code into Ruby with the help
of Github Copilot.

Copilot auto-completed exact comments from Robert's book, which likely means
it's pulling the code either from Robert's original Java, or from someone who
already transcribed it to Ruby.
